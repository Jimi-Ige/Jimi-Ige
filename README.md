I'm a technical program and project manager with a strong foundation in agile methodologies, project management, and organizational change management. I'm now focused on cloud and cybersecurity technologies. I hold certifications such as Security+ AZ-900, SC-900, and soon AZ-500. I have gained hands-on experience in enterprise-scale security architectures, Zero Trust frameworks, and DevSecOps automation. I am also pursuing the AZ-500 and CISM certifications to deepen my expertise.

## Objective
I aim to leverage my agile background and technical skills to deliver secure, scalable, and compliant cloud solutions. Through my portfolio, I demonstrate expertise in Azure Entra, Key Vault, and Azure Sentinel for incident response, showcasing how I align cloud security with business objectives.
